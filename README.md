OCT 2020 - MAY 2021

• The aim of the project was to improve on a 2020 paper exploiting the fact that during visual imagery/recall of complex visual stimuli, people perform involuntary eye movements that are similar to the ones made during looking at/encoding the same stimuli. The final goal of the project was to classify an image using only the recall eye movements.

• I created a software in Unity compatible with the Vive Pro Eye VR headset that was used during the eye data-gathering phase. This implied thorough research, and testing with exceptional attention to the UI in order to allow naive or experienced users to use the system remotely as the pandemic added this exceptional requirement. The software is flexible and it can be used in future similar studies as it allows futures researchers to change any parameters depending on their needs.

• The encoding and recall gaze data retrieved remotely is sent back to the researcher. I used this data together with multiple ML algorithms (such as LSTM, KNN-DTW, Random Forest etc.) to classify each stimulus. 

• I gained experience in writing Python code to pre-process and analyze the data before performing the classification task. I also had the opportunity to strengthen my knowledge using the NumPy, Pandas, Sklearn, PyTorch and Tensorflow python libraries.

• I gained experience using VR technology, as well as learning how to exploit its advantages such as impressiveness and work around its shortcomings such as eye fatigue and rather low resolution compared to eyesight.

• Even though this was a complex individual project that strengthened my time management skills and the ability to work autonomously, I also had to work with over 15 participants in order to test the prototypes and gather enough eye data for the classification ask. During this time, I became more receptive to feedback, strengthened my communication skills, adjusting my discourse depending on how knowledgeable the other person was, as well as following rigorous GDPR and ethical standards.
